#training and test error of quadratic classifier measured with 0-1 loss
#sgd parameters: epochs=10, learning rate=1, smooth hinge loss gamma=.5, train/test ratio=80/20
#d is the ambient dimension
#n is the sample size
#k is the projection dimension
#r is the algebraic dimension
#s is the parameter s in (Latorre et al, 2021) that determines the normalisation
#B is the rank of the boundary that determines the labels in the ambient space
#l is 1: random labels, 2:labels determined by matrix
#train is the training error
#test is the out-of-sample test error
